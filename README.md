# ECGNet: A Deep Learning Approach for ECG Classification
### Description
ECGNet leverages deep learning for ECG signal classification, distinguishing between normal and abnormal heart rhythms. This PyTorch-based project uses a specialized neural network architecture, featuring convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and ELU activations, to analyze ECG data. It is trained and evaluated on the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database from Kaggle, aiming for high classification accuracy, showcasing the model's capability in contributing to advanced cardiac diagnostics through machine learning technologies.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project, specifically for training the ECGNet model, is part of the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, available on Kaggle. This dataset is crucial for the project as it includes ECG recordings that have been labeled as normal or abnormal, providing a rich source of data for training and testing the model's ability to accurately classify ECG signals. The inclusion of this dataset supports the development of algorithms capable of distinguishing between different cardiac conditions, potentially contributing to advancements in diagnostic methodologies in healthcare.
