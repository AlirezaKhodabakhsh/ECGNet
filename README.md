# ECGNet: A Deep Learning Approach for ECG Classification
### Description
ECGNet is a deep learning model designed for the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals into different categories, such as normal or abnormal rhythms. Utilizing PyTorch, the project employs a custom neural network architecture that incorporates convolutional layers with constraints, batch normalization, dropout, and ELU activation functions to process and classify ECG data. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset from Kaggle, with the aim of achieving high accuracy in ECG signal classification.
